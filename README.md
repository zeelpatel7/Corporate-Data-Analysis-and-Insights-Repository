# Corporate-Data-Analysis-and-Insights-Repository


This repository includes comprehensive business case studies for McDonald's, Verizon, and Planet Fitness, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and final presentations to deliver actionable business insights. Each case study is structured to address specific business challenges through data-driven approaches, utilizing real-world data to explore trends, identify key factors affecting business performance, and make informed recommendations.

#### 1. McDonald's Case Study

The McDonald's case study addresses sales concerns raised by the Regional Sales Manager. The analysis includes EDA of sales transactions, regional demographics, and promotional activities. The study explores sales patterns, promotional impacts, and regional differences. Key techniques include visualizing data distributions, analyzing correlations, identifying clusters, and performing hypothesis testing. The findings help identify actionable insights, such as the impact of promotional campaigns like the all-day breakfast launch, and provide recommendations to optimize sales strategies.

#### 2. Verizon Case Study

The Verizon case study focuses on predicting customer defaults. EDA is performed to identify key drivers that contribute to customer payment behavior. A machine learning model is developed to predict defaults, leveraging features such as payment type, credit score, and purchase behavior. The model's performance is evaluated, and its potential business value is estimated to assist the Head of Sales and Retention in making informed decisions. The final deliverable includes a user-facing application that uses the trained model to predict customer defaults.

#### 3. Planet Fitness Case Study

The Planet Fitness case study aims to address customer churn, particularly among the fitness-curious audience. The study starts with EDA to understand customer behavior, identify risk factors for churn, and explore seasonality trends. A machine learning model is then developed to predict churn, focusing on key features that influence a customerâ€™s decision to stay or leave. The study concludes with a proposal of cost-effective strategies to manage churn, tailored to Planet Fitness's recent growth phase and the need to reduce operational costs.



These case studies demonstrate the practical application of data analysis, machine learning, and business problem-solving, providing valuable insights that help drive decision-making and strategy development for each organization.
